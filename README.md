# STM32F4_baremetal_FreeRTOS
 This repository contains all my code and experiments related to studying bare-metal embedded systems and FreeRTOS. It includes low-level peripheral drivers, startup code, and FreeRTOS tasks/examples targeting ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers. The goal is to deepen my understanding of embedded systems by working close to the hardware, without relying on high-level abstractions.
